## Udemy Clone: A Static Website (HTML & CSS)

This project is a static website replicating core aspects of Udemy, built using HTML and CSS. It showcases fundamental web development techniques to create a visually appealing and functional learning platform mockup.

# Features:

* **Layout with Flexbox:** The website utilizes flexbox for a clean and responsive layout on larger screens. While not fully responsive yet, this approach provides a strong foundation for future enhancements.
* **Element Positioning and Styling:** CSS is used effectively to position elements, define styles, and create a user-friendly interface that resembles the Udemy website.
* **Simple Animation:** A basic animation has been implemented to add a touch of interactivity to the user experience.
  
## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
  
## Development Notes:

* This is a static website and does not include any user interaction or dynamic elements.
* The responsiveness is currently limited to larger screens but can be further improved for optimal viewing across devices.
