## Udemy Clone: A Responsive Website (HTML & CSS)

This project is a responsive website replicating core aspects of Udemy, built using HTML and CSS. It showcases fundamental web development techniques to create a visually appealing and functional learning platform mockup that adapts to various screen sizes.

# Features:

* **Responsive Layout with Flexbox:** The website utilizes flexbox for a clean and responsive layout that adjusts to different devices (Phones, Tablets, Desktops).
* **Layout with Flexbox:** The website utilizes flexbox for a clean and responsive layout on larger screens. While not fully responsive yet, this approach provides a strong foundation for future enhancements.
* **Element Positioning and Styling:** CSS is used effectively to position elements, define styles, and create a user-friendly interface that resembles the Udemy website.
* **Simple Animation:** A basic animation has been implemented to add a touch of interactivity to the user experience.
  
## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
  
## Development Notes:

* While originally a static website, responsiveness has been implemented using media queries to enhance user experience across various devices.
* This website still lacks user interaction or dynamic elements. However, the foundation is laid for potential future development in that direction.
